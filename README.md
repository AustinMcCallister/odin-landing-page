Skills demonstrated during the course of this project include:

- Utilizing placeholder containers and classes to create flexible page layouts
- Breaking the main container sections into subsections using the flexbox model, in order to neatly align elements on the page and provide for flexibility around varying display resolutions
- Applying a variety of CSS styling techniques to give the page a modern and appealing appearance
